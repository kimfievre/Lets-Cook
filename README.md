# Lets-Cook

This mini-project was mainly for me to begin learning how to use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 
I was able to use Spoonacular's Food and Recipe API to create a simple webpage that provides a number of recipes
depending on what ingredients are entered. You may enter a number of ingredients, separated by commas, and click 'Add'.
When you want to start over, click 'Clear'.
